FBAM Supplementary Repository
================

This repository contains the code needed to run the simulation studies
and gait application analysis described in the article and the
supplementary material. See the individual README files in the `sim` and
`gait-analysis` directories.

Additionally, we have made available a [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brubakerconnor/fbam/) to
simplify the process of installing the `fbam` package and running the
code in this repository. See the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/)
for help on using Docker.
