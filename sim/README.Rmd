This directory contains the code necessary to replicate our simulation studies including the BMARD comparison and sensitivity analysis described in the supplementary material. To replicate a simulation, execute

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
cd /path/to/fbam-etc/
Rscript sim/sim_study.R ARGS
```

See the top of the `sim_study.R` file for a description of the possible command line arguments you may specify. This file was used to run the study described in the article and the sensitivity analysis described in the supplementary material. 

To run a BMARD comparison study, execute

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
cd /path/to/fbam-etc/
Rscript sim/comparison-study/BMARD_comparison.R ARGS
```

As before, see the top of the `BMARD_comparison.R` file for a description of the command line arguments.
